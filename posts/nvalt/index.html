A Simple text file with a simple delimiter like &mdash; or ### would have done to job but not always easy to search.</p>
<p>On macos, I came across this nice piece of tool called <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt">nvalt</a>.
This enables me to write new content as well as search in the pervious content with ease.</p>
